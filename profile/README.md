## 🧬 About Fossil Logic

Fossil Logic is a forward-thinking software development organization specializing in **low-level systems**, **AI explainability**, **secure infrastructure**, and **auditable software design**. We build intelligent technologies in **C, C++, Python, SQL**, and **CrabQL**—with a strong emphasis on **traceability**, **minimal dependencies**, and **self-contained logic**.

We’re not afraid to reinvent primitives to achieve software that is:

- 🧠 **Intelligent and Transparent** – Learning systems that can explain their reasoning.
- 🔐 **Secure by Design** – Built to resist manipulation and enforce integrity.
- ⚙️ **Cross-Platform and Efficient** – Engineered to run anywhere, lean and fast.

## 🚀 Our Flagship Projects

### 🧠 Jellyfish AI & Truthful Intelligence (TI)
- A blockchain-inspired AI system in C for **traceable, self-reflecting learning**.
- Focused on **truthful reasoning**, **input/output hashing**, and **tone-aware responses**.
- Core engine behind the **Truthful Intelligence** initiative.

### 🍕 Pizza Test
- A smart testing framework with **emotional tone**, **sarcasm detection**, and **fuzzy validation**.
- Used to test **TI modules**, language sanitization tools, and edge-case behavior.

### 🦈 Shark CLI
- Universal command-line interface for all Fossil Logic systems.
- Supports AI introspection, database ops, test execution, and module control.

### 🐟 This CLI
- Development environment helper for setup, build orchestration, and automation.

### 🐠 Fish CLI
- Runtime monitor and behavioral inspector for Jellyfish AI and Truthful Chains.

### 🦀 Crabd CLI & CrabCTL
- Shells for managing Blue Crab databases, distributed graph configurations, and audit queries.

### 🦀 Blue Crab Database
- Lightweight, graph-relational hybrid engine using **CrabQL**.
- Designed for **tamper-evident storage**, **logic-first queries**, and **modular shells** (MyShell, NoShell, TimeShell).

### 🧊 OpenCUBE
- Hardware-accelerated 2D/3D GUI library written in pure C.
- No external dependencies. Powers all graphical front-ends across Fossil Logic tools.
