## 🧬 About Fossil Logic

Fossil Logic is a forward-thinking software development organization specializing in **low-level systems**, **AI explainability**, **secure infrastructure**, and **auditable software design**. We build intelligent technologies in **C, C++,** and **Python**—with a strong emphasis on **traceability**, **minimal dependencies**, and **self-contained logic**.

We’re not afraid to reinvent primitives to achieve software that is:

- 🧠 **Intelligent and Transparent** – Learning systems that can explain their reasoning.
- 🔐 **Secure by Design** – Built to resist manipulation and enforce integrity.
- ⚙️ **Cross-Platform and Efficient** – Engineered to run anywhere, lean and fast.
